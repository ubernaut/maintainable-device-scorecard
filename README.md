# maintainable-device-scorecard

A simple way to score and rank the maintainability of devices and hardware

Open API with documentation?

Can the device be configured with human readable text files that can be managed independently?

Can the device be configured over SSH?

Can the device be configured over a web interface hosted directly on the device?

Can configurations be deployed to a fleet of devices en-masse?

Can configureations be deployed to a device through a simple provisioning process?

Can the device run self tests and roll back configurations that fail?

If the device supports authentication, can it be configured to use a domain authenticator/ oauth?

Does this device produce data in a standard format (JSON, CSV, XML etc.) or provide documentation for parsing their custom format? (full credit for human readable standard formats)

Does this device depend on cloud infrastructure the end user cannot control, replace, or run on their own? (0-9)

Does this device require you to install a mobile app to configure or manage it? ( 0-9)

Can the device be repaired or upgraded with modular electronic components?

Does this device run a standard operating system that can be patched, upgraded, and modified by the end user (think security patching or configuration)?

Open Source hardware specification (think RISC V)

What is the typical support lifetime by the manufacturer for software updates?

Does the manufacturer publish the MTBF (mean time before failure)?

Does the device have a secure supply chain?

Are cad files or detailed hardware specs available to support modifications and repair?

Does documentation exist for each of the relevant items above?
